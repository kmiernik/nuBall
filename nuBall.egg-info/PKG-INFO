        This package provides tools for nuBall HDF5 data files gating and
        analysis. The main script is nucubes.py which calculates gamma-gamma-gamma
        gates based on xml configuration file (see example file gates.xml)
        
        The qtnuSpectra.py is a simple Qt-based GUI for quick data analysis. In 
        works with gating result by nucubes.py saved to a HDF5 file.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package requires the following modules:
        * matplotlib
        * numpy
        * h5py
        * optional: numba for better performance
        
        This software was tested on Linux only, installation on other OS may require
        some manual intervention.  Installation module and scripts by pip is
        recommended.
        
        Warning: your distribution may use Python 2 as a default. If this is the
        case use python3 / pip3 instead of python / pip command.
        
        First create a source distribution
        
        ```
        $ python setup.py sdist
        ```
        
        Install it to for a local user
        
        ```
        $ pip3 install .
        ```

        ```
        $ sudo pip3 install .
        ```
        
        The scripts (nucubes.py and qtnuSpectra.py) should be now available from
        command line. If you chose local installation check if installation path
        is in the PATH variable.
